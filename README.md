# Hello I'm Yann.👋

I am a Computer Science student blending frontend experience with a strong passion for data engineering.
My very first experience was as a frontend Intern, where I was inrtoduced to good Development practices and started building my understanding of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).

Currently, I am pursuing a Bachelor's Degree  in Artificial Intelligence and Big Data, where I learn about data pipelines and Data literacy. 

I’m a learner building skills to connect applications with data systems. Right now, I’m focused on gaining hands-on experience, trying out new tools, and growing toward becoming a data engineer.
